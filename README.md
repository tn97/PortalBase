# UtilSuite

Credit goes to Conor Moschella, Timothy Na, and Ying Wang.
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and APIs (NYTimes, Giphy, Wikipedia, Spotify, and iexTrading).

This is a program that's purpose is for it's utility. It holds some things that may assist a user in everyday life, whether it be leisure, or doing some research/study.

Completely open-source, however, some of the API keys that are connected to our app name have been redacted for obvious reasons.

One issue we ran into is the lack of a constant api for what we require our mini-applications to do. The APIs expired between 1 hour and 1 month, creating an environment in which it became very difficult to test our app.

Our main goal is to one day have a wide library of programs run out of UtilSuite-An all-in-one program that will be the portal for users to get what they need, when they need it.
