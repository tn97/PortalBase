# PortalBase

This is a program that's purpose is for it's utility. It holds some things (not everything!) that may assist a user in everyday life, whether it be leisure, or doing some research/study.

Completely open-source, however, some API's that are connected to our app name have been redacted for obvious reasons.

The creators of Utilsuite may sniff glue, but we play nice with other developers!

Our main goal is to one day have a wide library of programs run out of UtilSuite-An all-in-one program that will be the portal for users to get what they need, when they need it.
